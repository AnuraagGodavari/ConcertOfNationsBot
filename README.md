# Lil-Buddy
A simple discord bot designed to work with several features, including database integration, emailing and the usage of APIs.

## Features
* Status tracking: can set users to be "status watched", which means Lil' Buddy will track them and post their newest custom statuses to a specified channel.

## How to run
Dependencies:
* Discord.py: A python wrapper for the Discord API used to make the bot itself
* dotenv: A python library which allows us to declare environment variables (ex. the bot's token, which is used to authenticate the bot and must remain secret)
